Pyrite is a basic text editor for Python. It features syntax highlighting, 
manual code completion, brace/bracket matching, line numbering, and 
the usual text editing functions (i.e. Copy, Cut, Paste, etc.).
The coloring can be completely changed with the settings.xml file, 
which is in simple XML that can be read and understood easily.
